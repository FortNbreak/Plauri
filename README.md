- Watching - While watching a movie in 4K, the Plex desktop app was at 1.4 GB while Plauri was using ~500 MB RAM.

*CPU Usage Tests*
Im not going to lie here. CPU-wise, Plex Desktop wins. ðŸ˜”
- IDLE - Sitting on idle (Home Page), the Plex desktop app was using 0% CPU while Plauri was using ~3%.
- Watching - While watching a movie in 4K, the Plex desktop app was using 0.3% CPU while Plauri was using ~6%

*GPU Usage Tests*
